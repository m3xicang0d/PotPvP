 * An ArenaSchematic is a template for creating Arenas. ArenaSchematics correlate

 * paste of said schematic file. Common attributes such as min/max player count
 * are stored in ArenaSchematics, as they are shared between all instances of an Arena,
 * where as specific things such as spawn points (which change per instance) are stored
 * in an Arena.
