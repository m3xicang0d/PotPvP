# PotPvP 1.8
A fork of PotPvP, porting it to 1.8 and changing mSpigot's dependency to VortexSpigot, RocketSpigot, CarbonSpigot


# Information
The Practice was configured so that it could be mostly YML, but due to lack of time I decided to leave the project as it is.


30% of the code is in kotlin, to prevent idiot kids from taking the code as their own.


# Note
I don't claim ANY ownership on this code, I have simply ported this to 1.8 with a few additions as my code. All ownership goes to Hylist/FrozenOrb. I made this open source because PotPvP forks are going all around the community being sold left to right, no point in having it privately saved.
Credit goes to FrozenOrb/HylistGames
Using this on your servers or forking it (and selling that fork) is allowed as far as I can give authority. All I ask is you keep the original developers' credits in there along with mine in there as "JesusMX". Not having these credits will be considered as you skidding this.

*The code was never cleaned correctly, since the time I have was not enough to be able to clean the practice correctly.*


# Dependency 
As many developers know that PotPvP requires qLib and mSpigot to function. While, qLib was removed and converted to kotlin in PotPvP-SI, mSpigot was never changed and remained as is for years. I changed this by porting PotPvP to 1.8

* ProtocolLib
* VoidWorld
* Holographic Displays
* BukkitAPI (LunarClientAPI)


# SUPPORT? 
I WILL NOT GIVE ANY SUPPORT, SINCE I AM RETIRED AND I AM NOT INTERESTED IN WASTING MY TIME WITH QUESTIONS.
